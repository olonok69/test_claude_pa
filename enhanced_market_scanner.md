I'll analyze these major tech stocks using all 5 trading strategies to provide you with a comprehensive market overview.Based on this comprehensive technical analysis of 10 major tech stocks, here are the key findings:

## Market Overview
The analysis reveals a **bearish technical environment** with only 1 out of 10 stocks showing buy signals (10%). This suggests caution in the current market conditions.

## Top Opportunities

**Adobe (ADBE)** stands out as the only clear buy opportunity with a Z-Score of -1.15, indicating oversold conditions. Despite its -33.6% decline over the past year, the technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound from current levels.

## Stocks to Avoid

Five major tech names are showing sell signals due to overbought conditions:
- **Oracle (ORCL)** - Despite strong +79% returns, Z-Score of 1.42 suggests overextension
- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** - Up +46.2% but technically overbought (Z-Score: 1.48)
- **Microsoft (MSFT)** - Solid +17.6% gains but overbought (Z-Score: 1.47)
- **Google (GOOGL)** - Modest +4.7% gains but technically extended
- **AMD** - Small +3.6% gains with highest overbought reading (Z-Score: 1.51)

## Neutral Holdings

Four stocks (AAPL, META, INTC, CRM) are in neutral territory, suitable for holding if already owned but not compelling new entry points.

## Strategic Implications

The technical analysis suggests many tech stocks may have run ahead of themselves, with Z-Scores indicating overbought conditions across major names. This could signal a potential cooling-off period or correction in the tech sector. Adobe's oversold condition presents a contrarian opportunity for investors willing to bet on a technical bounce.
