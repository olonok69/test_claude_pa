I have this mcp server with some financial tools server\main.py to be use with an mcp client and analyze the markets

 using the comprehensive analisys it is better than before but I think still lack some structure . somethging like Executive summary, detailed analisys and recomendations
 using the enhanced scanners seems to produce something quite different to the comprehensive one. You have examples of both in the repository
I give you the execution logs using Claude Desktop
I dont expect know if make sense to keep ehnanced and simply removed and extend , detail an structure a bit more the output of the comprehensive scanner
What do you think and Can you sorted out please?


comprehensive_market_scanner - Focuses on performance metrics and backtesting
enhanced_market_scanner - Focuses on current signals and market sentiment
