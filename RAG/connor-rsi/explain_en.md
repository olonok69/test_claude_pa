## What is Connors RSI?

**Connors RSI (CRSI)** is a technical indicator developed by **Larry Connors** that combines three different components to identify overbought and oversold conditions with greater precision than traditional RSI. It is especially effective for **mean reversion strategies** in short-term timeframes.

### Key Features:
- ‚úÖ **More accurate** than traditional RSI
- ‚úÖ **Fewer false signals**
- ‚úÖ **Better timing** for entries and exits
- ‚úÖ **Combines three perspectives** of momentum

---
### Traditional RSI
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is one of the most popular technical indicators in trading. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978 and is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes.

#### What does the RSI measure?

The RSI assesses whether an asset is overbought or oversold, ranging from 0 to 100. Traditionally:
- **RSI > 70**: Overbought zone (possible sell signal)
- **RSI < 30**: Oversold zone (possible buy signal)
- **RSI between 30-70**: Neutral zone

#### RSI Calculation

The RSI is calculated in several steps:

##### Step 1: Calculate Price Changes
For each period, the difference between the current and previous closing price is calculated.

##### Step 2: Separate Profits and Losses
- **Profit**: If the change is positive
- **Loss**: If the change is negative (the absolute value is taken)

##### Step 3: Calculate Averages
Moving averages of profits and losses are calculated, typically using 14 periods:
- **Average Gain (AG)**: Average of the profits over n periods
- **Average Loss (AL)**: Average of the losses over n periods

##### Step 4: Calculate RS (Relative Strength)
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss

##### Step 5: Calculate RSI
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

#### Practical Interpretation

The RSI is useful for:
- Identifying overbought/oversold conditions
- Detecting divergences with the Price
- Confirm trends
- Generate entry and exit signals

## The 3 Components of Connors RSI

### 1. Price RSI (33.33% weight)

```python
# Traditional RSI but with short period (3 days default)
price_rsi = rsi(close, rsi_period=3)
```

**What does it measure?** 
Traditional momentum of closing prices

**Interpretation:**
- `RSI > 50`: Bullish momentum
- `RSI < 50`: Bearish momentum
- Uses a shorter period (3) than traditional RSI (14) to be more sensitive

---

### 2. Streak RSI (33.33% weight)

```python
streak_rsi_values = streak_rsi(close, streak_period=2)
```

**What does it measure?** 
The persistence of consecutive up or down movements

**How it works:**
- Counts consecutive up days (+1, +2, +3...)
- Counts consecutive down days (-1, -2, -3...)
- Applies RSI to this streak series

**Practical example:**
```
Prices: 100 ‚Üí 101 ‚Üí 102 ‚Üí 101 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 99
Streaks:  0 ‚Üí  +1 ‚Üí  +2 ‚Üí  -1 ‚Üí  -2 ‚Üí -3
```

**Interpretation:**
- **High streak RSI**: There have been many recent bullish streaks
- **Low streak RSI**: There have been many recent bearish streaks

---

### 3. Percent Rank (33.33% weight)

```python
roc = close.pct_change() * 100  # Rate of change percentage
percent_rank_values = percent_rank(roc, rank_period=100)
```

**What does it measure?** 
What percentile the current price change is in compared to the last 100 days

**Interpretation:**
- **90th percentile**: Today's change is among the top 10% of the last 100 days
- **10th percentile**: Today's change is among the bottom 10% of the last 100 days

---

## Final Connors RSI Calculation

```python
# 1. Simple average of the three components
crsi = (price_rsi + streak_rsi_values + percent_rank_values) / 3

# 2. Conversion to score scale (-100 to +100)
connors_score = (crsi - 50) * 2
```

### Mathematical Formula:
```
CRSI = (Price_RSI + Streak_RSI + Percent_Rank) √∑ 3
```

---

## Level Interpretation

### Traditional CRSI Levels (0-100):
| Range | Condition | Signal |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **< 20** | **Extreme oversold** | üü¢ Potential buy signal |
| **20-80** | Normal range | ‚ö™ No clear signals |
| **> 80** | **Extreme overbought** | üî¥ Potential sell signal |

### Our Scoring System (-100 to +100):

```python
if score > 75:      # üü¢ "Strong Buy Signal"
elif score > 50:    # üü¢ "Buy Signal" 
elif score > 25:    # üü° "Weak Buy Signal"
elif score > -25:   # ‚ö™ "Neutral"
elif score > -50:   # üü° "Weak Sell Signal"
elif score > -75:   # üî¥ "Sell Signal"
else:               # üî¥ "Strong Sell Signal"
```

| Score Range | Signal | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **+75 to +100** | üü¢ **Strong Buy** | Very favorable conditions for buying |
| **+50 to +75** | üü¢ **Buy** | Favorable conditions for buying |
| **+25 to +50** | üü° **Weak Buy** | Slight bullish bias |
| **-25 to +25** | ‚ö™ **Neutral** | No clear signals, hold position |
| **-50 to -25** | üü° **Weak Sell** | Slight bearish bias |
| **-75 to -50** | üî¥ **Sell** | Favorable conditions for selling |
| **-100 to -75** | üî¥ **Strong Sell** | Very favorable conditions for selling |

## Practical Interpretation Example

### Analysis Result:
```
Symbol: AAPL, Period: 1y
Latest Connors RSI: 15.30
Latest Connors RSI Score: -69.40

Component Analysis:
1. Price RSI (33.33% weight): 25.50 -> Score: -16.33
2. Streak RSI (33.33% weight): 12.10 -> Score: -25.27
3. Percent Rank (33.33% weight): 8.30 -> Score: -27.80

Market Condition: Oversold (Potential Buy Signal)
```

### Detailed Interpretation:

1. **Price RSI (25.50)**: 
   - Price momentum is low
   - Indicates recent selling pressure

2. **Streak RSI (12.10)**: 
   - There have been many consecutive bearish streaks
   - Suggests the downtrend is losing strength

3. **Percent Rank (8.30)**: 
   - Current price changes are in the bottom 8% of the last 100 days
   - The current bearish movement is statistically significant

4. **Final CRSI (15.30)**: 
   - **Extreme oversold** condition
   - High probability of upward reversal

5. **Score (-69.40)**: 
   - **"Sell"** signal but very close to **"Strong Sell"**
   - Optimal time to consider a long position

## Typical Trading Strategy

### üü¢ Buy Signals

**Ideal Conditions:**
- ‚úÖ `CRSI < 20` (especially < 10)
- ‚úÖ All three components should be low
- ‚úÖ Wait for confirmation with CRSI increase

**Buy Setup Example:**
```
CRSI: 12.5 (extreme oversold)
Price RSI: 18.2 (low)
Streak RSI: 8.1 (many bearish streaks)
Percent Rank: 11.2 (movement in low percentile)
```

### üî¥ Sell Signals

**Ideal Conditions:**
- ‚úÖ `CRSI > 80` (especially > 90)
- ‚úÖ All three components should be high
- ‚úÖ Wait for confirmation with CRSI decrease

**Sell Setup Example:**
```
CRSI: 87.3 (extreme overbought)
Price RSI: 89.1 (high)
Streak RSI: 91.2 (many bullish streaks)
Percent Rank: 81.6 (movement in high percentile)
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

```python
# Combination with Z-Score for additional confirmation
if current_crsi < 20 and current_zscore < -1:
    # Oversold + statistically low price = Strong buy opportunity
    signal = "STRONG BUY"
    
elif current_crsi > 80 and current_zscore > 1:
    # Overbought + statistically high price = Strong sell opportunity
    signal = "STRONG SELL"
```

### üìã Recommended Trading Rules

1. **Entry**: 
   - Buy when CRSI < 20
   - Sell when CRSI > 80

2. **Confirmation**:
   - Wait for at least 2 of the 3 components to confirm the signal
   - Use 2-3% stop-loss from entry point

3. **Exit**:
   - Close longs when CRSI > 70
   - Close shorts when CRSI < 30

4. **Additional filters**:
   - Confirm with volume analysis
   - Verify technical support/resistance
   - Consider overall market context

- **High-frequency trading**: Reduce rank_period to 50

### 2. **Market Condition Adaptation**
```python
# Bull market: More aggressive buy signals
if market_trend == "bull":
    buy_threshold = 25  # Instead of 20
    
# Bear market: More conservative sell signals
elif market_trend == "bear":
    sell_threshold = 75  # Instead of 80
```

### 3. **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**
```python
# Check multiple timeframes
daily_crsi = calculate_connors_rsi_score("AAPL", period="1y")
weekly_crsi = calculate_connors_rsi_score("AAPL", period="2y")

# Only trade when both timeframes agree
if daily_crsi < 20 and weekly_crsi < 30:
    signal = "CONFIRMED BUY"
```
