# Donchian Channels
They are primarily an indicator of price ranges or channels
Although not strictly a volatility indicator, they can indirectly reflect market volatility
The width of the channel (distance between upper and lower bands) indicates recent volatility
When the channel widens, it indicates higher volatility
When it narrows, it indicates lower volatility

Donchian channels are a technical indicator consisting of three lines:

Upper Band: Represents the highest price during a specific period
Middle Band: Is the average between the upper and lower bands
Lower Band: Represents the lowest price during a specific period

How They Work
Donchian channels create a "channel" or range within which the price moves. These channels automatically adapt by expanding or 
contracting according to market volatility.

Buy and Sell Signals
In the chart, you can see green triangles (buy signals) and red triangles (sell signals):
Buy signals (Buy Signal - green triangles):

They are generated when the price breaks above the upper band
They indicate a possible bullish trend
In the chart, they are shown with green triangles pointing upward

Sell signals (Sell Signal - red triangles):

They are generated when the price falls below the lower band
They indicate a possible bearish trend
In the chart, they are shown with red triangles pointing downward

Trading Strategy:

Buy when the price breaks the upper band (green triangle)
Sell when the price breaks the lower band (red triangle)
Use the middle band as a reference for trends and as a possible support/resistance level

This system is particularly useful in markets that show defined ranges or clear trends. 
The chart also incorporates MACD for additional confirmation, showing the MACD line, signal line, and MACD histogram at the bottom.

# What is MACD?
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

It is a momentum indicator
It measures the speed and direction of price movement
It helps identify when price momentum is changing
It focuses on the strength and direction of a trend

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is a popular technical indicator that shows the relationship between two 
exponential moving averages (EMA) of an asset's price.
In the chart, you can observe:

MACD Line (blue): It is the difference between the fast EMA (usually 12 periods) and the slow EMA (usually 26 periods)
Signal Line (red): It is an EMA of the MACD line (usually 9 periods)
MACD Histogram: Shows the difference between the MACD line and the signal line (green and red bars)

How It Works
MACD works by measuring the momentum and direction of an asset:

When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it indicates bullish momentum
When it crosses below, it indicates bearish momentum
The histogram shows the strength of momentum (larger bars = stronger momentum)

Buy and Sell Signals with MACD

Buy signals:

Bullish crossover: When the MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line (red)
Bullish divergence: When the price makes lower lows, but the MACD makes higher lows
Zero line crossover: When the MACD line crosses above the zero line

Sell signals:

Bearish crossover: When the MACD line (blue) crosses below the signal line (red)
Bearish divergence: When the price makes higher highs, but the MACD makes lower highs
Zero line crossover: When the MACD line crosses below the zero line

In the chart shown, several crossovers can be observed between May 2024 and March 2025:

Green histograms indicate when the MACD line is above the signal line (bullish signal)
Red histograms indicate when the MACD line is below the signal line (bearish signal)
The strongest bullish momentum is observed in February-March 2025, coinciding with a large increase in volume

This indicator is particularly useful when combined with volume analysis (shown at the bottom of the chart), as signals are more reliable when backed by a significant increase in trading volume.

# Combined Strategy Explanation

I'll explain this combined MACD and Donchian channels strategy shown in the chart:

## Combined Scoring System

This strategy uses a sophisticated approach that assigns numerical scores (-100 to +100) to MACD and Donchian indicators, a
nd then combines them to generate more robust trading signals.

### MACD Score (-100 to +100)
Combines three components:
- **Position of MACD line vs signal line (40%)**: Positive when MACD is above the signal line (bullish)
- **Position of MACD line vs zero (30%)**: Positive when MACD is above zero (strong bullish trend)
- **Histogram momentum (30%)**: Measures the rate of change of the histogram

### Donchian Score (-100 to +100)
Combines three aspects:
- **Price position within the channel (50%)**: +50 at upper band, 0 at middle band, -50 at lower band
- **Channel direction (30%)**: Positive when the channel is moving upward
- **Channel width trend (20%)**: Positive when the channel is widening (increasing volatility)

### Combined Score
It's the simple average of the MACD and Donchian scores, giving equal weight to momentum (MACD) and price range (Donchian).

## Trading Signals in the Chart

In the chart, you can see four panels:
1. **Top panel**: TLSA price with Donchian channels
2. **Second panel**: MACD indicator with histogram
3. **Third panel**: Indicator scores (MACD, Donchian, and Combined)
4. **Bottom panel**: Visualization of trading signals with color-coded bars

### Interpretation of Key Moments:
- **February-March 2025**: Notice how MACD and Donchian scores rose above +50, generating a "Strong Buy Signal" (dark green bars). This coincided with a strong bullish movement in price.
- **April 2025**: Scores begin to fall and generate sell signals (red bars).
- **July-August 2024**: You can see a period of moderate buy signals, followed by a neutral phase.

### Benefits of This System:
1. **Simplifies** complex patterns by converting them to intuitive numerical values
2. **Normalizes** all indicators on the same scale
3. **Combines** different indicators into a single actionable signal
4. **Visualizes** indicator strength and transitions between states

### Practical Use:
- **Enter long positions**: When the combined score crosses above +50
- **Enter short positions**: When the combined score crosses below -50
- **Close positions**: When the combined score crosses zero in the opposite direction

This system is especially powerful because it combines a momentum indicator (MACD) with a price channel indicator (Donchian), offering a more complete view of the market.
