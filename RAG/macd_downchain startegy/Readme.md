## üéØ Overview

This project implements a sophisticated trading strategy that combines two powerful technical indicators:

1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** - A momentum indicator
2. **Donchian Channels** - A price range/volatility indicator

The strategy uses a novel scoring system that converts complex indicator patterns into intuitive numerical values (-100 to +100), making it easier to interpret market conditions and generate trading signals.

## üìà Financial Techniques

### Donchian Channels

Donchian Channels are primarily a **price range indicator** that can indirectly reflect market volatility:

**Components:**
- **Upper Band**: Highest price during a specified period
- **Middle Band**: Average of upper and lower bands  
- **Lower Band**: Lowest price during a specified period

**Key Features:**
- Channel width indicates volatility (wider = higher volatility)
- Automatic adaptation to market conditions
- Useful for identifying breakouts and trend reversals

**Trading Applications:**
- **Breakout Strategy**: Buy when price breaks above upper band, sell when below lower band
- **Mean Reversion**: Use middle band as support/resistance level
- **Trend Following**: Channel direction indicates overall trend

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

MACD is a **momentum indicator** that measures the speed and direction of price movement:

**Components:**
- **MACD Line** (Blue): Difference between fast EMA (12) and slow EMA (26)
- **Signal Line** (Red): EMA of MACD line (9 periods)
- **Histogram**: Difference between MACD line and signal line

**Key Signals:**
- **Bullish Crossover**: MACD line crosses above signal line
- **Bearish Crossover**: MACD line crosses below signal line
- **Zero Line Crossing**: Indicates trend strength
- **Divergence**: Price vs. MACD disagreement signals potential reversals

## üî¢ Scoring System

### MACD Score (-100 to +100)

The MACD score combines three weighted components:

1. **MACD Line vs Signal Line (40%)**
   - Positive when MACD > Signal Line (bullish)
   - Negative when MACD < Signal Line (bearish)

2. **MACD Line vs Zero (30%)**
   - Positive when MACD > 0 (strong bullish trend)
   - Negative when MACD < 0 (strong bearish trend)

3. **Histogram Momentum (30%)**
   - Positive when histogram increasing (accelerating momentum)
   - Negative when histogram decreasing (decelerating momentum)

### Donchian Score (-100 to +100)

The Donchian score combines three weighted components:

1. **Price Position Within Channel (50%)**
   - +50 at upper band
   - 0 at middle band
   - -50 at lower band

2. **Channel Direction (30%)**
   - Positive when channel trending upward
   - Negative when channel trending downward

3. **Channel Width Trend (20%)**
   - Positive when channel widening (increasing volatility)
   - Negative when channel narrowing (decreasing volatility)

### Combined Score

**Formula**: `(MACD Score + Donchian Score) / 2`

Gives equal weight to momentum (MACD) and price range (Donchian) indicators.

### Score Interpretation

#### Individual Scores:
- **Above +50**: Strong bullish
- **+25 to +50**: Moderate bullish
- **-25 to +25**: Neutral
- **-50 to -25**: Moderate bearish
- **Below -50**: Strong bearish

#### Combined Score Trading Signals:
- **+75 to +100**: üü¢ Strong Buy
- **+50 to +75**: üü¢ Buy
- **+25 to +50**: üü° Weak Buy
- **-25 to +25**: ‚ö™ Neutral (Hold)
- **-50 to -25**: üü° Weak Sell
- **-75 to -50**: üî¥ Sell
- **-100 to -75**: üî¥ Strong Sell

## üìä Trading Signals

### Entry Points

**Long Positions:**
- Combined score crosses above +50
- Both MACD and Donchian scores positive
- Price breaks above Donchian upper band with MACD bullish crossover

- Tighten stops when scores show early reversal signs
- Use MACD divergence as additional exit confirmation

### Diversification
- Don't concentrate all positions in one asset
- Consider correlation between selected instruments
- Monitor overall portfolio exposure

## üìà Examples

### Example 1: Strong Buy Signal
```
Symbol: TSLA, Period: 1y
Latest MACD score: 78.45
Latest Donchian score: 82.30
Combined score: 80.38
Interpretation: Strong Buy Signal
```

### Example 2: Neutral Market
```
Symbol: AAPL, Period: 6mo  
Latest MACD score: -12.50
Latest Donchian score: 15.20
Combined score: 1.35
Interpretation: Neutral
```

## üìã Benefits of This System

1. **Simplification**: Converts complex patterns into intuitive numerical values
2. **Normalization**: All indicators use the same -100 to +100 scale
3. **Combination**: Easily combines momentum and price range analysis
4. **Visualization**: Clear representation of indicator strength and transitions
5. **Customization**: Component weights can be adjusted for different strategies
6. **Automation**: Suitable for algorithmic trading implementation

## üîÑ Practical Implementation

### Trend Confirmation
When both MACD and Donchian scores agree (both positive or negative), it confirms a strong trend direction.

### Divergence Detection  
When scores move in opposite directions, it may indicate a potential trend reversal requiring closer attention.

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
- Use shorter periods (20 days) for swing trading
- Use longer periods (50+ days) for position trading
- Combine multiple timeframes for confirmation
