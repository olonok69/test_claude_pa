I'll run a comprehensive analysis using all 5 trading strategies to give you a complete picture of these tech stocks.This comprehensive analysis using all 5 trading strategies reveals some interesting insights about the current tech market landscape:

## Market Sentiment: BULLISH

The overall market sentiment shows a **bullish bias** with 30% of stocks displaying buy signals and notably, **zero sell signals** across all 10 major tech names. This is quite different from the previous analysis and suggests these stocks may be in a more favorable technical position when considering multiple indicators.

## Top Buy Opportunities

**NVIDIA (NVDA)** leads with the highest overall score of 19.4, indicating strong technical momentum across multiple strategies. Despite the recent -0.3% daily decline, the combination of all five indicators suggests bullish potential.

**Oracle (ORCL)** ranks second with a score of 16.5, showing consistent strength across technical indicators despite the -1.3% daily pullback.

**Microsoft (MSFT)** rounds out the top three with a score of 15.0, demonstrating technical resilience even with the minor -0.3% daily decline.

## Key Observations

1. **No Sell Signals**: Unlike the previous single-indicator analysis, this comprehensive approach shows no stocks in sell territory, suggesting the market may be in a more stable technical state when viewed through multiple lenses.

2. **Strong Concentration**: The top three buy signals (NVDA, ORCL, MSFT) are all showing positive technical momentum despite recent price weakness, potentially indicating buying opportunities on dips.

3. **Neutral Majority**: Seven stocks are in neutral territory, suggesting a wait-and-see approach may be appropriate for most positions.

4. **Adobe's Weakness**: ADBE shows the lowest score at -11.1, confirming its technical challenges identified in the previous analysis.

## Strategic Implications

The comprehensive multi-strategy approach suggests a more optimistic technical outlook than single-indicator analysis might indicate. The bullish bias with 30% buy signals and zero sell signals indicates that despite some near-term volatility, the underlying technical structure of these major tech stocks remains intact.

This analysis suggests focusing on NVDA, ORCL, and MSFT for potential new positions while maintaining existing holdings in the neutral-rated stocks.
