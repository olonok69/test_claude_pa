## 6. System Performance Issues and Opportunities

### 6.1 Recommendation Concentration Problem
**Issue**: Top session recommended to 98.1% of visitors
- Indicates over-reliance on popular sessions as fallbacks
- Reduces personalization effectiveness
- May overwhelm popular sessions with attendance

**Potential Causes:**
1. Low similarity thresholds (minimum 0.33)
2. Insufficient weight on differentiating attributes
3. Missing embeddings for specialized content

### 6.2 Coverage Gaps
**18 sessions (15.7%) never recommended:**
- 10 sponsored sessions lack recommendations
- Potential lost monetization/sponsor value
- AI governance session missing despite high AI interest

### 6.3 Visitor Segmentation Opportunities
**Underutilized segments:**
- 31 cross-event attendees (most engaged segment)
- 539 returning visitors (loyalty segment)
- International visitors (12.16% non-UK)

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

### 7.1 Immediate Actions
1. **Reduce fallback recommendations**: Increase minimum similarity threshold from 0.33 to 0.5
2. **Include sponsored sessions**: Generate embeddings for sponsored content
3. **Leverage returning visitor data**: Use last year's session attendance for better predictions
4. **Diversify recommendations**: Cap any single session at 50% of visitors

### 7.2 Data Enhancement
1. **Capture session attendance**: Track which recommended sessions visitors actually attend
2. **Add visitor segments**: Flag returning visitors, cross-event attendees, international
3. **Reduce NA values**: Implement better form validation (currently 6-7% NA)
4. **Expand categories**: "Other" represents 7.64% in Industry field

### 7.3 Algorithm Improvements
1. **Weight by entropy**: Give higher weight to high-entropy attributes (Industry, Solution Interest)
2. **Use historical behavior**: For 539 returning visitors, use past session attendance
3. **Implement diversity constraints**: Ensure recommendations span different topics/stages
4. **Time-slot awareness**: Avoid recommending concurrent sessions

### 7.4 Business Opportunities
1. **Retention programs**: Target 78.2% new visitors for next year retention
2. **Cross-event promotion**: Leverage 31 multi-event attendees as ambassadors
3. **Sponsored session integration**: Better integrate sponsor content into recommendations
4. **International tracks**: Consider region-specific content for 12% international audience

## 8. Conclusion

The recommendation system demonstrates good technical performance with 100% visitor coverage and reasonable similarity scores (median 0.69). However, the extreme concentration of recommendations (top session at 98.1%) indicates over-reliance on popular content as fallbacks, reducing personalization value.

Key strengths include complete data coverage, clear visitor intent alignment, and strong AI/digital transformation focus matching visitor interests. The 21.8% returning visitor rate provides valuable historical data currently underutilized.

Priority improvements should focus on:
1. Reducing recommendation concentration through higher similarity thresholds
2. Leveraging returning visitor history (539 visitors)
3. Including sponsored sessions in recommendations
4. Implementing diversity constraints to ensure varied content exposure

The system has strong foundations but needs refinement to deliver truly personalized experiences that justify the data collection effort and provide value to both visitors and sponsors.
