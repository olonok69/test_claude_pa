### 5. SHOW-SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN

#### 5.1 Main Event (ECE/BVA) Performance

**Registration & Attendance:**
| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Pre-registered | X | - |
| Venue attendance | Y | Z% of registered |

### 6. CRITICAL ISSUES - DEEP DIVE

#### 6.1 The Venue-to-Session Gap

**The Problem:**
- X visitors scanned badges (came to venue)
- Y visitors attended at least one session
- Gap: Z visitors (Z%) came but attended NOTHING
- Impact: Wasted X recommendations

**Root Causes:**
1. Late arrivals missing scheduled sessions
2. Venue attractions (exhibit hall) vs sessions
3. Poor session timing
4. Recommendation timing (too early/late)
5. Room capacity/finding issues

**Evidence:**
[Specific data supporting each cause]

**Pre-Show Warning:**
- Report [DATE]: "Concern about venue vs session attendance"
- Recommendation: "Track separately and analyze"
- Status: Tracked post-event, could have been monitored real-time

**Impact:**
- Recommendation waste: Z recommendations sent but never had chance
- Sponsor exposure loss
- Engagement opportunity loss

#### 6.2 The Over-Recommendation Problem

**The Problem:**
- Top 5 sessions recommended to >90% of visitors
- Actual conversion rates: 1.5-2.5%
- Result: 98% of recommendations wasted on these sessions

**Reality Check:**
```
Session: "Where eCommerce is Headed"
Recommended to: 7,325 visitors (98.7%)
Actually attended: 145 visitors
Conversion rate: 1.98%
Waste: 7,180 (98%) recommendations had no effect
```

**Root Cause:**
- Similarity threshold too low (0.5)
- Insufficient diversity constraints
- Dominant cluster (AI interest) overwhelmed algorithm
- Weights not optimized for differentiation

**Pre-Show Warning:**
- First identified: August 20, 2025
- Repeated in: 3 reports
- Recommendation: Raise threshold to 0.6-0.7
- Status: ‚úó Never implemented
- Predicted outcome: "Complete personalization failure"
- Actual outcome: **Prediction 100% accurate**

**Impact:**
- Personalization effectively failed
- All visitors got nearly identical recommendations
- Defeats entire purpose of recommendation system

#### 6.3 The Sponsor Problem

**The Problem:**
- 31 sponsored sessions received ZERO recommendations
- Sponsors paid for exposure
- System excluded them entirely

**Financial Impact:**
- Estimated sponsor value: $XX,XXX per session
- Total at risk: $XXX,XXX
- Reputational damage: HIGH

**Sponsor Sessions That Performed Well (Despite No Recommendations):**
| Session | Sponsor | Attendance | Conversion if Recommended |
|---------|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| Session X | Sponsor A | 87 | Could have been 2,000+ |

**The Bitter Irony:**
- Some never-recommended sessions had EXCELLENT organic attendance
- If recommended, could have been major successes
- Proves recommendation system works when used correctly

**Pre-Show Warning:**
- First identified: August 20, 2025
- Recommendation: "Force inclusion for sponsored sessions"
- Status: ‚úó Never implemented
- Business risk: **CRITICAL** - sponsor contracts at risk

#### 6.4 The Recommendation Conversion Problem

**The Problem:**
- Overall email ‚Üí recommended session attendance: 12.8%
- Wide variance: 0% to >100% conversion
- Indicates broken targeting calibration

**Evidence:**
- 45% of sessions: <10% conversion (too broadly recommended)
- 15% of sessions: >50% conversion (well targeted)
- 20% of sessions: 0% conversion (complete failure)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Poor similarity matching
2. Threshold too low (over-recommendation)
3. Timing issues (recommendations too early/late)
4. Lack of diversity in recommendations
5. Not considering capacity/popularity

**Impact:**
- System credibility damaged
- User trust in recommendations low
- Sponsor ROI questionable

#### 6.5 The Calibration Problem

**The Problem:**
- Massive variance in conversion rates
- No consistent performance pattern
- Suggests algorithm not properly tuned

**Evidence:**
- Best session: 615% conversion (under-recommended by 84%)
- Worst sessions: 0% conversion (should never have been recommended)
- Top recommended: 1.98% conversion (over-recommended by 98%)

**Root Cause:**
- No calibration against historical attendance
- No capacity awareness
- No popularity adjustment
- Pure similarity matching without business logic

**Impact:**
- Resource allocation failures
- Overcrowding risk in under-recommended popular sessions
- Empty rooms in over-recommended niche sessions

#### 6.6 The Late Registration Gap

**The Problem:**
- Visitors who registered in last 2 weeks: X
- These received fewer/no recommendations
- Attended Y% fewer sessions than early registrants

**Evidence:**
| Registration Period | Count | Avg Recommendations | Hit Rate | Sessions Attended |
|--------------------|-------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Early (>30 days) | X | 20.5 | 28.3% | 3.4 |
| Mid (15-30 days) | Y | 20.2 | 26.1% | 3.1 |
| Late (<15 days) | Z | 12.3 | 18.7% | 2.3 |

**Impact:**
- Late registrants underserved
- Missed engagement opportunity
- System not optimized for continuous registration
