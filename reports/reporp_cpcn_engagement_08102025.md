# CPCN Engagement Mode Analysis Report - Neo4j Production Database

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Clinical Pharmacy Congress North (CPCN) 2025 engagement mode pipeline run in the Neo4j production database. **Engagement mode** re-engages last year's attendees (CPCN 2024) by treating them as "this year's" cohort and generating personalized session recommendations for the upcoming CPCN 2025 event (November 21-22, 2025). The pipeline successfully processed **1,576 returning visitors** from CPCN 2024 and generated **15,760 recommendations** (10 per visitor) across **73 available sessions** for CPCN 2025.

## 1. Event Overview

- **Event Name**: Clinical Pharmacy Congress North (CPCN) 2025
- **Show Code**: `cpcn`
- **Event Dates**: November 21-22, 2025
- **Configuration File**: `config/config_cpcn.yaml`
- **Pipeline Mode**: **Engagement** (re-engaging CPCN 2024 attendees)
- **Database**: Neo4j Production (via MCP connector `neo4j-test`)
- **Report Generation Date**: October 8, 2025

### Engagement Mode Context

**Engagement mode** is a specialized pipeline configuration that:
- Treats **last year's attendees** (CPCN 2024) as "this year's" visitor cohort
- Generates recommendations for **this year's sessions** (CPCN 2025) to re-engage returning visitors
- Uses historical attendance patterns (`attended_session` relationships) to inform recommendations
- Maintains the same 10-step pipeline as personal agenda mode but with reconfigured show filters

**Show Configuration in Engagement Mode:**
```yaml
engagement_mode:
  registration_shows:
    this_year_main: ["CPCN24", "CPCN2024"]      # Prior-year codes
    this_year_secondary: ["CPC2025", "CPC25"]   # Paired event

## 6. Data Quality and Completeness

### 6.1 Attribute Fill Rates

| Attribute | Fill Rate | NA/Missing Count | NA % |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|------|
| Country | 99.5% | 8 | 0.5% |
| Visitor Type (`you_are_a_please_select_the_most_appropriate_option`) | 97.8% | 35 | 2.2% |

## 8. Recommendations and Action Items

### 8.1 For Engagement Team

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Deliver recommendations to CPCN 2024 attendees**: Use the generated recommendation exports to create personalized email campaigns
2. **Highlight top sessions**: Promote the top 3 sessions (professional leadership, pharmacy technician roles) in engagement communications
3. **Target pharmacy technicians**: Create specialized messaging for the 241 pharmacy technicians (15.3% of cohort) highlighting the 3 pharmacy technician-focused sessions in the top 4

**Strategic Considerations**:
1. **Leverage historical attendance**: Emphasize sessions similar to the 2024 Chief Pharmaceutical Officer keynote (most attended session) in marketing materials
2. **Address low-recommendation sessions**: Review the 20 sessions that received no recommendations:
   - Assess if these are niche specialist topics that need targeted outreach
   - Consider adding more detailed descriptions or stream assignments to improve discoverability
3. **Geographic targeting**: With 98.6% UK audience, focus engagement efforts on UK-based pharmacy professionals

### 8.2 For Data and Pipeline Team

**Data Quality Improvements**:
1. **Stream assignment**: 33 sessions (45.2%) lack stream assignments - prioritize adding streams to improve recommendation relevance
2. **Session descriptions**: Verify that all 73 sessions have complete, detailed synopses for embedding generation
3. **Technical Services stream**: Update stream description to be pharmacy-specific (currently appears to be a library/information management template)

**Pipeline Enhancements**:
1. **Increase historical attendance coverage**: Currently only 20.1% of visitors have historical attendance data. Investigate:
   - Scan data collection completeness for CPCN 2024
   - Badge ID matching logic between years
2. **Recommendation diversity**: With uniform 10 recommendations per visitor, consider:
   - Adding diversity/novelty metrics to prevent over-concentration on top sessions
   - Implementing session capacity awareness for popular sessions
3. **Session coverage**: Address the 27.4% of sessions never recommended:
   - Review recommendation algorithm thresholds
   - Consider adding "long tail" recommendation logic to expose less popular sessions

### 8.3 For Event Planning

**Session Programming Insights**:
1. **Maintain leadership focus**: Strong demand for pharmacy leadership and professional development topics
2. **Expand pharmacy technician content**: High engagement with pharmacy technician sessions suggests opportunity for expanded programming
3. **Balance clinical and professional**: The mix of clinical topics (insomnia, prescribing) and professional development (leadership, wellbeing) resonates well with the audience
4. **Consider capacity planning**: Top session recommended to 79.95% of visitors (1,260 people) - ensure venue capacity can accommodate demand

## 9. Next Steps and Pipeline Transition

### 9.1 Switching Back to Personal Agenda Mode

When ready to resume standard personal agenda recommendations for new CPCN 2025 registrations:

1. **Archive engagement outputs**: Save or move the current `data/cpcn/output/` and `data/cpcn/recommendations/` directories
2. **Update configuration**: Change `mode` from `"engagement"` to `"personal_agendas"` in `config/config_cpcn.yaml`
3. **Remove engagement overrides**: Comment out or remove the `engagement_mode.registration_shows` section
4. **Refresh input files**: Update registration and demographic JSON files with current CPCN 2025 registrations
5. **Re-run pipeline**: Execute the full 10-step pipeline to rebuild Neo4j nodes and generate personal agenda recommendations

### 9.2 Recommended Re-run Timing

- **Now**: Engagement mode complete - deliver to engagement team
- **2-4 weeks before event**: Switch to personal agenda mode to support live attendees
- **Day before/during event**: Final personal agenda refresh with most current registration data

## Appendix A: Engagement Mode Methodology

**What is Engagement Mode?**

Engagement mode is a configuration of the personal agenda recommendation pipeline specifically designed to **re-engage past attendees** with the upcoming year's programme. Instead of building recommendations for newly registered visitors, it:

1. **Treats last year's attendees as "this year's cohort"**: CPCN 2024 attendees become `Visitor_this_year` nodes
2. **Links to historical attendance**: Creates `Same_Visitor` relationships to connect current records to their `Visitor_last_year_lva` nodes
3. **Leverages past behavior**: Uses `attended_session` relationships from CPCN 2024 to inform recommendations for CPCN 2025
4. **Recommends this year's sessions**: Generates personalized recommendations for CPCN 2025 sessions based on past preferences and demographic similarity

**Pipeline Flow** (same 10 steps as personal agenda mode, but reconfigured):
1. Registration Processing â†’ filters CPCN24 as "this year"
2. Scan Processing â†’ processes historical scans as past attendance
3. Session Processing â†’ loads CPCN 2025 sessions
4-7. Neo4j Uploads â†’ creates visitor, session, and stream nodes
8. Visitor Relationships â†’ links CPCN24 visitors to their historical records
9. Embeddings â†’ generates semantic embeddings for CPCN 2025 sessions
10. Recommendations â†’ creates personalized recommendations leveraging attendance history

**Key Advantage**: Zero code changes required - same processors, same database, just different configuration filters.
