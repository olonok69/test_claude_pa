## 9. Configuration Analysis

### 9.1 Similarity Attributes & Weights

| Attribute | Weight | Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **job_role** | 0.8 | High - appropriate for role differentiation |
| **what_type_does_your_practice_specialise_in** | 0.8 | High - appropriate for clinical matching |
| **organisation_type** | 0.8 | High - may be too high for org type |
| **Country** | 0.5 | Medium - appropriate for geographic preferences |
| **are_you_a_distributor_to_the_profession** | 0.6 | Medium-High - appropriate |
| **are_you_a** | 0.6 | Medium-High - purpose unclear |

### 9.2 Recommendation Settings

| Parameter | Value | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| **min_similarity_score** | 0.3 | ✅ Appropriate threshold |
| **max_recommendations** | 10 | ✅ Good target |
| **similar_visitors_count** | 3 | ⚠️ Could be increased to 5-7 |
| **enable_filtering** | true | ✅ Essential for vet rules |
| **returning_without_history.enabled** | true | ✅ Good boost for returning visitors |
| **returning_without_history.similarity_exponent** | 1.5 | ✅ Appropriate boost level |
| **theatre_capacity_limits.enabled** | true | ✅ Managing venue constraints |
| **theatre_capacity_multiplier** | 3.0 | ✅ Reasonable oversubscription factor |

| Feature | Status | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Specialization Stream Mapping** | ✅ Enabled | 87.9% coverage (good but improvable) |
| **Job Role Stream Mapping** | ✅ Enabled | 84.7% coverage (good but improvable) |
| **Veterinary Filtering Rules** | ✅ Enabled | Perfect compliance (zero violations) |
| **Practice Type Transformations** | ✅ Enabled | Handles BVA/LVA past year data differences |

### 9.4 Configuration Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Veterinary-specific filtering rules perfectly enforced
- ✅ Appropriate weights on clinical specialization (0.8)
- ✅ Historical attendance boost configured (1.5× for returning visitors)
- ✅ Stream mapping features enabled for both job role and specialization

**Recommended Adjustments:**
1. **Increase similar_visitors_count**: 3 → 5-7 (improve recommendation diversity)
2. **Reduce organisation_type weight**: 0.8 → 0.5-0.6 (less critical for session matching)
3. **Verify "are_you_a" attribute**: Clarify purpose and confirm 0.6 weight is appropriate
4. **Review theatre_capacity_multiplier**: Monitor if 3.0× is causing recommendation constraints
