**Signal:** NEUTRAL  

**Component Scores:**
- MACD Score: 9.66/100

**Analysis:** Both momentum (MACD) and breakout (Donchian) indicators show very low scores, suggesting minimal directional momentum. The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase with neither strong bullish nor bearish signals.

### 4. Connors RSI & Z-Score Combined Analysis (1-Year Period)

**Signal:** WEAK BUY  

**Component Analysis:**

## Summary Table

| Strategy | Score | Signal | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| Bollinger Z-Score (20-day) | 0.88 Ïƒ | Hold | Normal Range |
| Bollinger-Fibonacci (1Y) | 5.00/100 | Hold | Neutral |
| MACD-Donchian (1Y) | 9.53/100 | Neutral | No Clear Direction |
| Connors RSI-Z Score (1Y) | 38.22/100 | Weak Buy | Modest Bullish |
| Dual MA EMA 50/200 (1Y) | 16.2/100 | Neutral | Limited Momentum |

## Final Recommendation: **HOLD with Cautious Optimism**

### Rationale:

**Neutral Consensus:** Four out of five strategies suggest neutral to hold positions, indicating Tesla is in a consolidation phase without strong directional bias.

**Modest Bullish Undertone:** The Connors RSI-Z Score combination provides the only bullish signal (weak buy), suggesting some underlying positive momentum that other indicators haven't fully captured.

**Technical Position:** Tesla is trading above key moving averages and within normal volatility ranges, indicating a stable technical foundation.

**Risk Considerations:**
- Limited momentum across multiple timeframes
- Mean reversion potential from current elevated Z-Score levels
- Consolidation phase may continue before next significant move

### Trading Strategy:
1. **Current Holders:** Maintain positions with stop-loss below $290 (lower Bollinger Band)
2. **New Buyers:** Wait for a pullback to $315-320 range for better entry
3. **Active Traders:** Consider range trading between $290-345 until clear breakout occurs

### Key Levels to Watch:
- **Resistance:** $345 (Upper Bollinger Band)
- **Support:** $315 (50-day EMA), $290 (Lower Bollinger Band)
- **Breakout Level:** Sustained move above $350 or below $285
