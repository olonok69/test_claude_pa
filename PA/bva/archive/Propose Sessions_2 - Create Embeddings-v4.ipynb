It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

A lack of understanding of their physiology and clinical quirks due to (until recently) little undergraduate teaching on the subject, can render novel or emergency camelid calls stressful. But don’t panic – you have many skills that are easily transferrable to camelids, and coupled with a little bit of nuanced knowledge, they can help you triage and treat emergency cases.\\n\\xa0\\nBridge Knowledge Gaps\\nPractices may be reluctant to take on a novel species, particularly one that can suffer from accelerated disease processes, carrying emotional and commercial value as both companions and commercial stock. In the author’s experience of working with camelids, it is evident that most owners wish to pursue diagnostics and embark upon schemes and practices that benefit their herd, which could be welcome news to vets already offering such services to different species. With insight from experienced production animal veterinarians, there is potential to reduce communicable disease transmission among other farmed species. It is therefore in all our interest that camelid owners are informed on matters of disease risk reduction and biosecurity – to do this, we must, as production vets, make efforts to extend clinical services in the hope of having these important discussions.\\n\\xa0\\nSession Outline\\nThis session aims to arm cattle practitioners with the skills required to undertake clinical examination and determine differential diagnoses for common, emergent camelid presentations. Emphasis will be put on breaking down camelid triage, and giving you east steps to provide first opinion care.

Drug selection is mutlifactorial and when it comes to exotics many vets will reach for 'Baytril' in exotic animals because it is licensed, it is considered a 'safe' drug in exotic species, it can be effective, and knowledge may be lacking of 'safe' alternatives nevermind the doses. Unfortunately, many of the infections in exotics we see are often secondary to stress induced immunocompromise resulting in normal microflora becoming opportunistic pathogens. Without correcting the underlying issue then at best we will achieve control not cure, leading to yet more antibiotics being prescribed.Antibiotic selection in exotics (mamamls,birds, reptiles) is a massive topic to cover in one session, so come join me for a whirlwind tour of drug selection, pain assessment, and husbandry considerations that will reduce the stress of the individual animal, promoting immunocompetance, and empower you to make logical drug choices of first line antibtiotics and know when it is appropriate to reach for the fluoroquinolones.\", 'sponsored_by': 'Not Sponsored', 'start_time': '14:35:00', 'sponsored_session': 'False', 'date': '2025-06-13', 'theatre__name': 'Clinical Theatre 2', 'similarity_score': 0.6458513, 'recommendation_reason': 'Similar to session attended by similar visitor'}\n",

They are called foulbrood because they affect the developing larvae which, when they die, produce a foul smelling odour. The diseases are global and have been known since ancient times. Aristotle described the conditions in his lifetime. American Foulbrood is caused by a rod shaped bacterium, Paenibacillus larvae, which exists in a spore form and a vegetative form. European Foulbrood is a bacterium, Melissococcus plutonius which does not sporulate. The pathogenesis of these infections are quite different and if left will destroy the colony. They are highly infectious and can easily spread with the behaviour of bees and the actions of beekeepers. Most European countries have these diseases classed as notifiable with the legal requirement that if suspected, it must be reported to the authorities for examination by a bee inspector. If a positive diagnosis is made, then mandatory destruction of the colony, with euthanasia and burning is required for AFB. EFB diagnosis will usually require euthanasia and burning but in some cases, shook swarm procedure or antibiotics can be utilized.

A lack of understanding of their physiology and clinical quirks due to (until recently) little undergraduate teaching on the subject, can render novel or emergency camelid calls stressful. But don’t panic – you have many skills that are easily transferrable to camelids, and coupled with a little bit of nuanced knowledge, they can help you triage and treat emergency cases.\\n\\xa0\\nBridge Knowledge Gaps\\nPractices may be reluctant to take on a novel species, particularly one that can suffer from accelerated disease processes, carrying emotional and commercial value as both companions and commercial stock. In the author’s experience of working with camelids, it is evident that most owners wish to pursue diagnostics and embark upon schemes and practices that benefit their herd, which could be welcome news to vets already offering such services to different species. With insight from experienced production animal veterinarians, there is potential to reduce communicable disease transmission among other farmed species. It is therefore in all our interest that camelid owners are informed on matters of disease risk reduction and biosecurity – to do this, we must, as production vets, make efforts to extend clinical services in the hope of having these important discussions.\\n\\xa0\\nSession Outline\\nThis session aims to arm cattle practitioners with the skills required to undertake clinical examination and determine differential diagnoses for common, emergent camelid presentations.

European Foulbrood is a bacterium, Melissococcus plutonius which does not sporulate. The pathogenesis of these infections are quite different and if left will destroy the colony.
