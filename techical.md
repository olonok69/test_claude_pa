- **Avoid:** Connors RSI+Z-Score, Dual MA in volatile sectors

### 4. Risk Management Priorities
- **Position sizing crucial** due to extreme volatility
- **Strategy diversification** recommended given varied effectiveness
- **Stop-loss discipline essential** for unsuccessful strategies

### 5. Sector-Specific Technical Edge
Unlike traditional sectors, **clean energy and EVs show genuine technical trading opportunities** due to:

## Key Takeaways

1. **Technical Analysis Works in Volatile Sectors:** 28.9% strategy success rate vs. near-zero in trending markets
2. **Mean Reversion Strategies Excel:** Bollinger-based approaches most consistent

## Disclaimer

The clean energy and EV sector's higher volatility and cyclical nature create conditions more favorable to technical analysis than trending sectors. Past performance does not guarantee future results, and all trading involves substantial risk of loss.
