file https://dev.azure.com/sceven/DataDetect/_git/Detect-AI?path=/image/image_captioning/endpoint_image_captioning.py&version=GB5196-PoC-computer-Vision-Models&_a=contents

## Endpoint to integrate with Detect

Endpoint runing in port 5010 under url http://localhost:5010/process. Expect only POST request. This endpoint take an Image on base64 format and produce a summary of what you see on the image.

#### Parameters Request:

- max_new_tokens: The maximum numbers of tokens to generate, ignoring the number of tokens in the prompt.  Default 30
- min_new_tokens: The minimum numbers of tokens to generate, ignoring the number of tokens in the prompt. Default 10
- temperature: The value used to modulate the next token probabilities. Default .9
- repetition_penalty:The parameter for repetition penalty. 1.0 means no penalty. See this paper for more details. Default .1 
- diversity_penalty: This value is subtracted from a beamâ€™s score if it generates a token same as any beam from other group at a particular time. Note that diversity_penalty is only effective if group beam search is enabled Default .8
- no_repeat_ngram_size: If set to int > 0, all ngrams of that size can only occur once. Default 3
- num_beams:  Number of beams for beam search. 1 means no beam search. Default 1

If num_beams = 1 repetition_penalty  and diversity_penalty have no effect

## Run docker

This docker has GPU support and you will need to activate it at runing time

docker run --rm -it --gpus all -p 5010:5010/tcp image_captioning:latest
