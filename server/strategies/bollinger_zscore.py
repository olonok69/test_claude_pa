        Calculate the Bollinger Z-Score for mean reversion analysis.
        
        The Bollinger Z-Score is a technical indicator used to assess the position of a 
        security's price relative to its Bollinger Bands. It's a normalized measure that 
        helps traders understand whether a price is relatively high or low compared to 
        its recent trading range.

        Interpretation:
        - Z-Score of 0: Current price is exactly at the middle Bollinger Band (SMA)
        - Positive Z-Score: Price is above the middle band (potentially overbought)
        - Negative Z-Score: Price is below the middle band (potentially oversold)
        
        Trading Guidelines:
        - Z-Score > +2: Price considered overbought (potential sell signal)
        - Z-Score < -2: Price considered oversold (potential buy signal)
        - Z-Score between -2 and +2: Price within "normal" trading range

        Important Considerations:
        - Trend: Z-Score should be interpreted with overall trend context
        - Volatility: More volatile securities have wider bands and larger Z-Score fluctuations
        - False Signals: Can generate false signals in trending markets

        Parameters:
        symbol (str): Stock ticker symbol to analyze
        period (int): Period for calculating moving average and standard deviation (default: 20)
