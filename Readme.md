This application consists of three integrated components working together to provide comprehensive AI-powered search capabilities:

1. **Streamlit Client** - AI chat interface with multi-provider support, authentication, and SSL support
2. **Google Search MCP Server** - Web search and content extraction via Google Custom Search API
3. **Perplexity MCP Server** - AI-powered search with intelligent analysis via Perplexity API

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/mcp_platform_architecture.svg)

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Google Custom Search API key & Search Engine ID
- Perplexity API key
- OpenAI API key or Azure OpenAI configuration

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# AI Provider Configuration (choose one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# OR Azure OpenAI Configuration
AZURE_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name
AZURE_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview

# Google Search Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_custom_search_engine_id

# Perplexity Configuration
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
PERPLEXITY_MODEL=sonar

# SSL Configuration (Optional)
SSL_ENABLED=true
```

### 2. API Setup

#### Google Custom Search Setup
1. **Get API Key**: Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable Custom Search API, create credentials
2. **Create Custom Search Engine**: Go to [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/), create new search engine, get Search Engine ID

#### Perplexity API Setup
1. **Get API Key**: Sign up at [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai) and get your API key
2. **Choose Model**: Select from available models (sonar, sonar-pro, sonar-reasoning, etc.)

### 3. User Authentication Setup

Generate user credentials for the application:

```bash
cd client
python simple_generate_password.py
```

This creates `keys/config.yaml` with default users. You can modify user credentials as needed.

### 4. SSL Certificate Setup (Optional)

For HTTPS support, certificates will be generated automatically when `SSL_ENABLED=true`.

### 5. Launch the Platform

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Or start individual services
docker-compose up mcpserver1    # Perplexity MCP Server
docker-compose up mcpserver2    # Google Search MCP Server  
docker-compose up hostclient    # Streamlit Client
```

### 6. Access the Application

#### HTTPS Mode (Recommended)
- **Main Interface**: https://localhost:8503
- **Security**: Self-signed certificate (accept browser warning)

#### HTTP Mode (Default)
- **Main Interface**: http://localhost:8501
- **Alternative**: http://127.0.0.1:8501

#### Health Checks
- **Google Search Server**: http://localhost:8002/health
- **Perplexity Server**: http://localhost:8001/health

#### Authentication
Use the credentials generated in step 2 (default: admin/very_Secure_p@ssword_123!)
